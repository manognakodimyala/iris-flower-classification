🌸 Iris Flower Classification Project

This project is a Machine Learning web application that classifies Iris flowers into three species:

🌼 Setosa

🌷 Versicolor

🌹 Virginica

The model predicts the flower species based on the following features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

This project is built using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

🚀 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Streamlit
